# Problem Statement
Due to strategic moves from other competitors and ineffective decision-making in management, AtliQ Grands are losing its market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels category. As a strategic move, the managing director of AtliQ Grands wanted to incorporate “Business and Data Intelligence” to regain their market share and revenue. However, they do not have an in-house data analytics team to provide them with these insights.

Their revenue management team had decided to hire a 3rd party service provider to provide them with insights from their historical data.

# Project Goal
The goal of this project is to conduct a comprehensive analysis of the hotel domain using Python. By employing data-driven insights and strategic recommendations, my aim is to empower Atliq Grands to make informed decisions and regain a competitive edge in the industry.
